Algorithms
==========

A series of programming problems written and solved in Python.

Instructions
---------
Download this folder as a .zip and start solving problems from the '(Questions)' .py files.
The questions are all setup already. They specify an ideal time efficiency, and include test cases that you can uncomment out and run to ensure your function works.

If you get stuck or want to compare solutions, you can access the given solution from the corresponding '(Solutions)' .py file. 
(*Note, most questions have many different possible solutions, and the given solution is only one possible approach.)

Please let me know if you find any issues or would like the methods better to be commented.

Topics Covered
--------
Problems cover the following topics:
- Arrays and Strings
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs and Trees
- Bit Manipulation (in progress)
- Data Structures: (in progress)

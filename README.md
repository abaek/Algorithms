Algorithms
==========

A series of programming problems written and solved in Python.

Instructions
---------
Download this folder as a .zip and start solving problems from the '(Questions)' .py files.
The questions are all setup already. They specify efficiency, and include test cases that you can comment out to ensure your function works

To look over my solution, access the question from the corresponding .py file. 
(*Note, most questions have many different possible solutions, and my solution is only one of the possible ways to solve it.)

Problems cover the following topics:
- Arrays and Strings
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs and Trees
- Bit Manipulation
- Math
- Data Structures:
